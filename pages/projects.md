## <a href="https://www.leonardespi.me/automation-learn/" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"> Automation Learn <a>


##### Overview

I created this site and guide when I received my first promotion to a staff position. At the time, I was both excited and nervous — suddenly responsible for the growth of so many people. So, I built this guide as the kind of mentorship experience I wish I’d had: something clear, practical, and human. It’s meant for my colleagues, peers, and especially my mentees. 

It contains: 

- An extended guide to make a jump from Manual tester to automation test engineer
- A Demo site to put in practice the most common challenges as an automation tester
- A GH repository with exercises on each topic from zero to hero!!

##### Outcome

A continuous and well prove learning path to transform testers in automation test engineers
