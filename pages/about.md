I’m Leo—Senior SDET, songwriter, and lifelong learner. I thrive on discovering new ideas, whether through books, courses, instruments, or writing. Of all the things I’ve explored, programming is where I’ve grown the most and continue to deepen my craft.


I grew up with a Deaf mother, which taught me early that communication extends far beyond words. Reading gestures, expressions, and actions shaped me into someone attentive, empathetic, and detail-oriented—traits I bring to engineering and to life.


My guiding belief is simple: technology, music, and ideas should be accessible to everyone. Professionally, that translates into a mindset of **build, test, improve—so no one is left out**. Personally, I value authenticity: sharing what I learn, listening to other people’s stories, and building real connections. I also write—songs, personal projects, and reflections—with the goal of creating spaces where people feel seen, heard, and part of something larger.


If anything defines me, it’s a commitment to steady growth—not out of haste, but from genuine curiosity and the desire to **build work that lasts**.

# What motivates me


From a young age I saw how often technology overlooks people. Small moments—like sharing a song or placing a call—made that gap visible at home. My mother is not a victim in this story; she’s a hero. Despite profound hearing loss, she graduated as a translator and speaks five languages. While foreign languages never came easily to me, I discovered I could program—and that is a language, too.

After the pandemic, I watched developers add live captions to online meetings. They weren’t perfect, but they opened a door: a way to bring my mom closer to the world we share. That moment clarified my path. I want to build—and rigorously test—technology that includes everyone.
