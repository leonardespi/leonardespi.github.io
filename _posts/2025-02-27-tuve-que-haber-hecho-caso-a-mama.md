“**I should’ve listened to Mom**” was born from that frustration you feel when you realize—too late—that, in fact… your mom was right.

It’s that constant sense of urgency—like the porters at the Central de Abastos—keeping you from stopping to think things through calmly. And of course, impatience leads you to make mistakes, miss opportunities, and in the end, all you’re left with is the song… an attempt to rewind that silent *“I told you so”* echoing in your head.

The chorus, “**I should’ve listened to Mom**,” is, I’d say, the purest form of a lament—the acceptance that by rushing too much you ended up alone, paired with the awareness that you can no longer fix the mess.

It’s a song about learning the value of patience the hard way, and the regret of not having listened to the person who loved you most.

It’s also the end of the brief nine-minute journey that ***chilaquiles con recuerdo*** takes you on: after passing through that muddled hope and anxiety, reaching the peak of an anger that—though big—never wishes harm, it closes with the resignation that you made a mistake, and there’s nothing more you can do about it.
