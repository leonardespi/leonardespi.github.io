Today I want to talk to you about a topic that’s been a roller coaster in my life: **personal productivity**.

Between courses, books, and YouTube, we hear a thousand times about systems like **GTD (Getting Things Done)**, **PARA**, **Zettelkasten**, **Time Blocking**, and many others.
But the real struggle is certainly **not knowing they exist**, but **making them work**.

### What are GTD and PARA, and why is everyone talking about them?

**GTD**, created by David Allen, is a method built on a very powerful idea:

> **Your mind is for having ideas, not for holding them.**

In GTD, everything starts by capturing EVERYTHING outside your head—into lists, inboxes, or digital tools—and then processing and organizing it into clear actions.

**PARA**, by Tiago Forte, is more modern and minimalist:

> **Organize all your information into four areas: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives.**

This way, instead of getting lost in a sea of folders or endless lists, you know exactly where to store and where to find anything.

* **Projects**: everything with a goal and a deadline (e.g., launch your website, finish your thesis).
* **Areas**: everything you maintain continuously (e.g., health, finances, relationships).
* **Resources**: reference material for when you need it (e.g., articles, courses, templates).
* **Archives**: things completed or no longer relevant that you still want to keep.

### Does real productivity come from using a perfect system?

At least in my experience, what I can tell you is **no**.

What makes the difference isn’t using *Notion*, *Keep Notes*, *Obsidian*, or the prettiest tool in the world.

What matters is **having a system (even an ugly one) that gets things out of your head and lets you clearly see what to do next**.

Because in the end, **being productive isn’t doing more things**. **It’s doing better the things that truly matter.**

So if you’re starting out or want to improve your workflow:

* **Start small**: A notebook, a simple app—whatever you can maintain.
* **Refine over time**: Don’t marry a method. Steal what works for you from each one.
* **Remember that productivity is not an end. It’s a means to live better.**

Because at the end of the day, **what matters isn’t being more productive… it’s being freer.**

See you in the next post!
