“**Chilaquiles y alambre**” is part of the EP *Chilaquiles con recuerdos*—the beginning of a journey. It speaks to the feeling of a love once close that has faded. The song is about a memory that, though **ephemeral**, is also constant and sharp; simple things like the rumble of the metro or a plate of green chilaquiles are enough to set synapses firing in our brains.

I wanted to capture the bittersweet sensation of missing someone—so intensely that you see their ghost in every ordinary corner, like in the passing trains. I kept recalling those simple yet powerful moments: meeting their family, trading jokes over chilaquiles and long conversations. The way those memories turned into soft stabs when I faced the current distance is essential to the song.

But amid all that feeling, a part of me clung to the idea that such affection couldn’t just vanish. That’s why the line “**te espero con el cora abierto**” (“I’m waiting with my heart wide open”) and that final “**plissss vuelve ya**” (“please come back now”) are truly a whisper from the heart—a whisper from a heart still beating hard for that person.

It was like trying to trap in words the thought: **“they’re gone… but maybe…”**
