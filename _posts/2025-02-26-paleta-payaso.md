“**Paleta Payaso**” was born from the silly, dumb, foolish confusion that infatuation leaves you with.

It’s as if someone walks past you and, suddenly, the world fills with colors and promises. That quick idealization—that feeling of being intensely loved from the start—clouds your judgment.

You buy into the story of the beautiful, smiling person who kisses you and says they love you. But then the mask falls, and you see the arrogance, that it was all a strategy—blatant **love bombing**.

The song is that mix of anger at having fallen so naively, of feeling like a manipulated child, and, at the same time, that pang of having wanted to be **“the one.”**

And in the end, all the anger you have stays in your hands, because you’re not capable of hurting that person; you wish them things like a piece of gum stuck to their shoe, or that their **Paleta Payaso** turns out ugly.

It’s a raw song about the disappointment of a false love and the vulnerability of getting caught in its net.
