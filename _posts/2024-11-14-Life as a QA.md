## **How it is the day to day of a Quality Assurance Engineer?**

Hey there!

My name is Leo, and I'm a senior QA engineer (almost QA lead).

I'd like to use this post and your presence, dear reader, to tell a story about software engineering that's not that commonly talked about. For me, being a QA is the best path I could ever have chosen (important to mention that I've been on many other paths, such as development, data analytics and engineering, web development, even some managing roles!). And what I was able to conclude after that journey is...

>  Good heavens! I love getting paid for breaking stuff.



### QA engineering in a nutshell 

In the world of software development, Quality Assurance is **the art of prevention.** Like detectives predicting a criminal's next move, QA professionals use their skills to identify weak spots in software applications before they cause trouble for users. This involves employing various **testing techniques, risk analysis, and intuition** to ensure a smooth and error-free user experience. 

QA is also a **balancing act** between advocating for **quality and usability** from the user's perspective and understanding the technical constraints of development. It's about finding the **sweet spot between perfection and timely delivery.** 

Ultimately, QA is **more than just "testing."** It encompasses **process improvement, defect prevention, and collaboration** with the development team to build the best possible product.



### In comparison with development 

In the dynamic world of software development, developers are the architects and builders, creating amazing applications. QA engineers, on the other hand, come in with their metaphorical wrecking balls to **ensure those creations are solid and can withstand the forces of real-world users.**  

Think of it as a partnership where developers are the artists creating a beautiful sculpture, and QA engineers are the art critics analyzing it from every angle to **ensure its structural integrity and aesthetic appeal.** This highlights the **different mindsets** at play: developers focus on "how to make this work," while QA engineers focus on "how can this fail?" This **crucial difference in perspective** ensures a well-rounded approach to software quality.  

Developers and QA engineers are **allies, not enemies.** Both teams share the common goal of delivering the best possible product to users. 



### How to become a QA engineer

Aspiring QA engineers will be relieved to know that **there is no single path** to this career. While a computer science degree can be beneficial, it's not always a requirement.  Many QA professionals come from **diverse backgrounds**, including information technology, software engineering, customer support, and technical writing. The key is to possess a **strong aptitude for problem-solving and a passion for quality.**  

However, it's essential to **build your skills** along the way.  Learn about software testing methodologies, different testing types (functional, performance, security, usability, etc.), and industry-standard techniques like black-box, white-box, and gray-box testing.  Familiarize yourself with various testing tools, from open-source options like Selenium to commercial tools like HP ALM. 

To gain practical experience, **prepare for the dirty work.** Start with personal projects, contribute to open-source software, or look for internships. **Nothing beats real-world experience.** 

Finally, **cultivate essential qualities** such as detail-orientation, analytical thinking, curiosity, and strong communication skills. These qualities are crucial for documenting bugs, communicating findings to developers, and advocating for quality within the team.



### What goes after being a QA

**QA Lead/Manager:**  Lead and mentor a team of QA engineers, overseeing testing processes and ensuring quality standards are met. This role often involves more strategic planning, resource allocation, and performance management.

**Specialized roles:** Focus on specific areas like performance testing, security testing, or automation.  Become an expert in a particular domain and contribute your specialized knowledge to complex projects.  For example, a performance testing specialist might focus on load testing and stress testing to ensure software can handle high user traffic.

**Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET):**  Develop tools and frameworks to automate testing processes.  SDETs possess strong programming skills and contribute to the development of automated testing scripts and frameworks, improving efficiency and test coverage.

**Product Owner:**  Transition into a role focused on defining and prioritizing product features.  With your deep understanding of user needs and product functionality, you can effectively guide product development and ensure alignment with user expectations.

**Project Manager:**  Apply your organizational and communication skills to manage software projects, ensuring they are delivered on time and within budget.



#### Key points

- QA is a critical part of the software development process.
- It's a challenging and rewarding career path with lots of growth potential.
- If you have a passion for quality and a knack for finding problems, QA might be the perfect fit for you!
