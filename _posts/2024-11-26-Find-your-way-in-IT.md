Hey there folks!

My name is Leo currently a senior QA engineer. In the next lines I want to talk about choosing a career, I know it is a crucial decision, and in the tech world, with so many options, it can be overwhelming! If you're reading this, you're probably at that point, evaluating which path to take within the IT universe. And believe me, I understand!

**This post is not a magic guide to finding your calling**, but rather a story of my own experience, hoping to inspire you and help you navigate this sea of possibilities.

From the age of 12, I knew that programming was my thing. Python was my first love, and along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I launched myself into the working world as a junior full-stack developer at 15. (we all know that position just means labor exploitation)

During my time as a web developer, I explored different areas: **Data Science, web development**... until finally, I discovered automation! I liked to automate my daily tasks to save time and thinking effort (I even automated my daily clothes selection). Selenium was my gateway to one of the branches of this fascinating world, and through it, I learned about the role of QA.

After 3 years as a python developer I was looking for a career change, I was looking for something more dynamic, entertaining and where I could exploit my creativity, so I decided to **take a turn in my career and become a QA for a video game consultancy firm**. 

Initially I thought they were going to pay me to play video games (a dream when I was a kid), but it turned out to be much more than that in this role I would learn all the basics of QA, its mentality, its objective...

And what can I say? **I fell in love!**

I was no longer there to play video games, the idea of **being paid to "break things"**  (find bugs in software) seemed incredibly appealing to me.

In this position, I learned all about the responsibilities of a QA, the tools, the soft skills and the characteristics necessary to be successful. Over time I needed more and more QA, I fell into a couple more consultancies where I would be in several projects in different industries, over time I would specialize in different types of tests: **API testing, UI testing, Unit testing, Automation testing, Manual testing**... And as my soft skills developed, I took on new responsibilities within my teams, **test strategy, test management, DevOps etc.** (THE standard path of increasing vertical responsibilities within a role)

**My path was not linear**. I experimented, explored and learned from each experience until I found my true passion. And that is my main recommendation for you: **don't be afraid to try new things!** Maybe your first job is not the final one, but each step will bring you closer to your goal. 

**Remember:**

- **Research the different areas:** web development, mobile application development, cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, cloud computing... There is a world of possibilities!
- **Try different programming languages and frameworks:** Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, React, Angular, Vue... Each one has its own characteristics and applications. (Python, Java and Lua are my favorites)
- **Don't limit yourself to the technical:** develop your soft skills, such as communication, teamwork and problem solving. They are essential for any career in IT.
- **Seek mentors and connect with other professionals:** learn from their experiences and expand your network. (Connect with me on LinkedIn!)
- **And above all, enjoy the process!** The IT world is constantly evolving, so stay curious and never stop learning. 



I hope my story inspires you to find your own way in the exciting world of technology. Good luck on your adventure! 



See you in the next post!!!
