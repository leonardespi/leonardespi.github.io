*A compact field guide you can revisit*

The **System for Thought and Action (SPA)** is a modular architecture for personal organization that integrates knowledge management, goal planning, and task execution. Unlike other systems, SPA enables the **creation of new knowledge** by fusing and maturing ideas that come from different life areas.

It is designed as a functional network of components that interact both hierarchically and bidirectionally—from deep thinking to everyday action—through a continuous process of iteration.

## 1) The story & intent

SPA was born after 6 years of iterations that started from a simple frustration: I wasn't able at all to organize myself, ideas lived in one place, my daily routine in another, and my expectations and ambitions in a third — none of them talked or were related. After trying to use Notion's second brain, GTD, PARA (even habitica lol), I decided to create yhe **System for Thought and Action** in spanish **Sistema de Pensamiento y Accion (SPA)** as a solution to unify all of my islands. It treats your knowledge, goals, and time as one living network so that **what you learn becomes what you ship**—reliably and on purpose.

**Core:** translate personal knowledge into tangible outcomes, starting from who you are, then moving through your life areas, projects, and finally into scheduled action.

## 2) Why this system works?

* **Bridges knowing and doing.** Ideas mature into goals, then tasks, then calendar time blocks.
* **Creates new knowledge.** Notes cross-link across life areas so patterns and insights emerge.
* **Adapts to your tools.** It’s methodology-first and tool-agnostic.
* **Scales with you.** Works for artists, engineers, students, founders — anyone who ships.
* **Encourages reflection.** Built-in review loops sustain momentum and learning.

## 3) The model (four layers, one flow)

Think of SPA as a layered stack with feedback:

#### First layer

**Keep (Fast memory / cache)**: Quick capture of fragments, checklists, and frequently used info. It’s the inbox and scratchpad for ideas.

#### Second layer

**Vault (Deep knowledge)**: Linked notes where ideas mature: your life areas, your domains, your projects, reflections. *(Essentially is your identity in a file system vault)*

#### Third layer

**Tasks (Decisions)**: You use tasks to develop projects, domains and eventually areas in your life, the goals are decomposed into executable steps. 

#### Fourth layer:

**Calendar (Time-boxing)**: Blocks on the calendar are translated into accountble time spended on working for tasks and routines it gives all the projects  the required  attention for deep work, habits, and commitments.

<br>

**Flow:** Capture in **Keep** → mature in **Vault** → commit in **Tasks** → protect in **Calendar** → **Review** and feed learnings back into Vault.

## 4) Quick example 

**Goal:** Run a half marathon.

1. **Vault**: *Area – Health* → *Domain - Running* → *Project – Half Marathon*; note motivations, constraints, references.
2. **Tasks**: Create sized tasks (S: pick training plan; M: buy shoes; L: long run; XL: monthly check-in).
3. **Calendar**: Block Tue/Thu (45m) + Sun (90m).
4. **Keep**: Pinned note with routes, shoe size, hydration checklist.
5. **Daily**: Execute blocks; move tasks; jot micro-learnings.
6. **Weekly**: Adjust plan, log progress in *Domain – Endurance Running* as patterns emerge.

<br>

*note: people usually dont just casually decide to run half marathon, if you're one of those people, you probably already have a health area and even a domain in running, domains are not meant to mutate that frequently or easily much less the Areas*

## 6) How to start

If you are interested in starting using spa, I strongly recommend you visit the [spa repo](https://github.com/leonardespi/spa), there you will find a much more extensive documentation and even the download of the boilerplate (if you want to use the recommended tools)
