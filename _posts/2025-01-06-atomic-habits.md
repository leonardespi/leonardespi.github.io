Today I want to tell you about a book that not only I liked, but that marked a before-and-after in how I think about personal growth: *Atomic Habits* by James Clear.

Before reading it, I was the kind of person who thought that to change my life I needed grand, epic moments: the perfect project, the perfect diet, the perfect Monday.
Spoiler: that epic moment rarely arrives.

What *Atomic Habits* taught me was far more powerful:
Real change comes from small actions you repeat consistently—not from isolated big decisions.

Some concepts that impacted me:

* **Identity comes first:** It’s not enough to want to “write a book”; you have to start by seeing yourself as a writer, even if no one reads you yet.
* **The power of 1%:** Improving just 1% each day seems insignificant, but over time it transforms you completely.
* **Design your environment:** Don’t rely solely on willpower. Make your environment work in your favor (e.g., if you want to read more, keep books visible and within reach).

Applying it changed many areas of my life:

* Instead of obsessing over “finishing a giant project,” I started celebrating writing one page a day.
* Instead of wanting to “get in shape,” I focused on doing 10 minutes of exercise daily, no matter how busy I was.

And most importantly:
I began to be much kinder to myself in the process.

I used to think that missing a day was a disaster. Now I understand that imperfect consistency still beats sporadic intensity by a long shot.

If you’ve ever felt stuck between wanting to change and not knowing where to start, this book can be an incredible compass.

You don’t need to change everything today. You just need to get a little better—every day.
