After a long and well-deserved break, I’m back to this project. Today I want to talk about a topic that was central during the months I was away: job interviews. Some people hate them, others love them. But if you’re in the first group, think of it this way: an interview is your stage to shine. *(If you’re in the second group, you can skip this post.)*

### Preparation is Power

As Benjamin Franklin said, “If you fail to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” **Not doing your research shows a lack of interest.** Go beyond memorizing facts; understand the company’s mission, vision, and values, its culture, and the specific role. At the very least, take the time to Google the company *(I don’t think you want to join a company only to find out later it’s being investigated by the FBI).*

Don’t memorize robotic answers, but do **have your key messages** and concrete examples clear. Remember that while you don’t need to control the interview, it’s essential to demonstrate confidence and certainty in the answers you give the panel.

At the end of the day, an interview is a conversation. Asking **well-thought-out questions** shows interest and critical thinking. Avoid asking obvious things or focusing only on benefits at the start. Ask about the recruiter’s history at the company, what a typical day looks like, etc.

**Details matter!** Test your tech in advance. Dress professionally *(Don’t make my mistake and wear a baseball jersey).* Greet confidently, maintain eye contact throughout the interview, smile, and be kind to everyone.

Once you’ve made it past introductions, conversation, and the Q&A, remember the interview doesn’t end when you walk out. If the stated timeline passes without news, a polite follow-up email is appropriate. If you get a “no,” thank them professionally; it’s a learning experience. And if you get an offer—congratulations!

**Remember**

* **Preparation is everything**: Research, practice your answers, and ask smart questions.
* **Communicate with impact**: Verbally and non-verbally, using STAR to provide evidence.
* **Follow-up matters**: A thank-you note makes a difference.

Every interview is an opportunity to learn and move closer to your goal. **Trust your preparation, be authentic, and go for it!**

See you in the next post!
