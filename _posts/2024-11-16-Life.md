## Why is it important to have a balanced life?

Hey there folks!

My name is Leo, I'm a senior software engineer, an athlete and musician. I decided to write this post to address a crucial issue in our nowadays society. It has become common that we don't have time to *live*. Most of the time can go in uptight meetings, a horrendous stack of to-dos or mindlessly scrolling through TikTok. It is important that we claim back time to make room for the important things in life.



Once I read an amusing book called "Momo", in a nutshell "Momo" talks about a little girl raised in the suburbs far away from the city where people were always busy, rushing around, and obsessed with saving time. **They were so focused on being efficient that they forgot how to truly live.** Momo, with her wisdom and ability to listen, helps them rediscover the beauty of the present moment

The story teaches us about the importance of **not being cheap with our time** and use it wisely, as it is the only asset that we will never get back.  It's a powerful reminder that **life isn't about squeezing every last drop of productivity** out of every minute. 



>  Life it's about savoring the journey, appreciating the people around us, and finding joy in the simple things.



Time is our most valuable asset, and we often treat it like it's an unlimited resource, but the truth is, it's the one thing we can never get back.  Think about it: we can make more money, we can buy new things, but we can't rewind the clock. Every second that ticks by is gone forever.

For myself, it's key to make room in life for working, studying, being healthy, creating art and spending life with those that I love.

I'm in love with my job, and after it I always like to hit the gym and train two hours to be healthy and strong, after that I practice guitar or spend time talking and having a great time with my family, girlfriend or friends. This balance is essential for me.  It keeps me energized, fulfilled, and prevents burnout.  By dedicating time to different aspects of my life, I feel like I'm truly living, not just existing.

#### Key points

- **Time is precious:**  Don't let it slip away on autopilot. Be mindful of how you spend it.
- **Prioritize what matters:**  Identify the things that bring you joy and make time for them, even if it means saying "no" to other things.
- **Find your balance:**  There's no one-size-fits-all solution. Experiment and find what works best for you.
- **Live in the present:**  Don't dwell on the past or worry about the future.  Embrace the now.



It's time to reclaim our time and start living a life that is truly balanced and fulfilling.
