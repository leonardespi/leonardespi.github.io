Hi, I’m Leo. I work as a Sr SDET, I enjoy writing music and I'm coconuts about enchiladas.
**If there’s one thing I’m passionate about, it’s learning:** I love spending my time discovering new things—whether reading books, taking courses, playing a new instrument, or starting to write a book I’ll publish someday. **Among the things I’ve most enjoyed learning—and where I keep growing—is programming.**

I come from a home where I learned from an early age that communication goes far beyond words; I grew up alongside a deaf mother, which taught me to **read life in gestures, glances, and actions.** This shaped a very important part of who I am: someone expressive, empathetic, and attentive to details many overlook.

I’m driven by the idea that **technology, music, and ideas should be accessible to everyone.** My professional focus has always been guided by that belief: **build, test, improve, so no one is left out.** On a personal level, I value authenticity. **I like to share what I learn, listen to other people’s stories, and truly connect.**

In addition to technology and music, I have a creative streak that sometimes leads me to write—whether songs, personal projects, or simply reflections. **I dream of continuing to create spaces where people can feel seen, heard, and part of something bigger.**

**If anything defines me,** it’s that I always seek to grow—not out of haste, but out of genuine curiosity and the desire to **build something that leaves a mark.**

Experience doesn’t mean knowing everything, but knowing how to keep learning.

## What motivated me

Since I was a child, I realized that technology wasn’t always made for everyone. Growing up with a mother who cannot hear shaped my way of seeing the world. Simple moments, like sharing a song or making a call, revealed that reality to me.

> I have felt the weight of technology that doesn’t consider everyone, and that drives me to be part of the change.

Don’t get me wrong: my mom isn’t a victim in this story—she’s a hero. Despite having an almost total hearing loss, she graduated as a translator and speaks five languages. Cool, right?

Unlike my mom, foreign languages never came easily to me, but I could program—and that’s a language too.

One day, after the pandemic, I saw that certain developers managed to add captions to online meetings. They weren’t perfect, but they opened a door: a way to bring my mom closer to the world we share.

That day I decided I wanted to be part of the change.
