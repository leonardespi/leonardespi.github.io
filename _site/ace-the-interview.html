    <p>After a long and well-deserved break, I’m back to this project. Today I want to talk about a topic that was central during the months I was away: job interviews. Some people hate them, others love them. But if you’re in the first group, think of it this way: an interview is your stage to shine. <em>(If you’re in the second group, you can skip this post.)</em></p>

<h3 id="preparation-is-power">Preparation is Power</h3>

<p>As Benjamin Franklin said, “If you fail to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” <strong>Not doing your research shows a lack of interest.</strong> Go beyond memorizing facts; understand the company’s mission, vision, and values, its culture, and the specific role. At the very least, take the time to Google the company <em>(I don’t think you want to join a company only to find out later it’s being investigated by the FBI).</em></p>

<p>Don’t memorize robotic answers, but do <strong>have your key messages</strong> and concrete examples clear. Remember that while you don’t need to control the interview, it’s essential to demonstrate confidence and certainty in the answers you give the panel.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, an interview is a conversation. Asking <strong>well-thought-out questions</strong> shows interest and critical thinking. Avoid asking obvious things or focusing only on benefits at the start. Ask about the recruiter’s history at the company, what a typical day looks like, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Details matter!</strong> Test your tech in advance. Dress professionally <em>(Don’t make my mistake and wear a baseball jersey).</em> Greet confidently, maintain eye contact throughout the interview, smile, and be kind to everyone.</p>

<p>Once you’ve made it past introductions, conversation, and the Q&amp;A, remember the interview doesn’t end when you walk out. If the stated timeline passes without news, a polite follow-up email is appropriate. If you get a “no,” thank them professionally; it’s a learning experience. And if you get an offer—congratulations!</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Preparation is everything</strong>: Research, practice your answers, and ask smart questions.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate with impact</strong>: Verbally and non-verbally, using STAR to provide evidence.</li>
  <li><strong>Follow-up matters</strong>: A thank-you note makes a difference.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every interview is an opportunity to learn and move closer to your goal. <strong>Trust your preparation, be authentic, and go for it!</strong></p>

<p>See you in the next post!</p>
