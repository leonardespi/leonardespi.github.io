    <p>Today I want to talk about a subject that has accompanied me through many stages of my life, though not always consciously: the art of loving. I call it an art because, as I discovered while reading Erich Fromm, love is not something that simply happens; it is something you learn, cultivate, and refine.</p>

<p>When I read <em>The Art of Loving</em>, I understood something that—though it sounds obvious—we often forget: true love is neither an accident nor an everlasting love-at-first-sight. It is an active decision and a constant practice.</p>

<p>Fromm explains that loving involves much more than feeling attraction. To love is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Care, without intruding.</li>
  <li>Know, without controlling.</li>
  <li>Respect, without idealizing.</li>
  <li>Take responsibility, without possessing.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that, believe me, is harder than it seems.</p>

<p>It made me think:
How many times have I expected love to “feel nice” all the time, without making the real effort to build it?
How many times have I mistaken comfort or emotional need for genuine love?</p>

<p>Loving, like any art, demands preparation, patience, and dedication. No one expects to play the piano perfectly without practice. No one should expect to love in a healthy way without learning, making mistakes, and improving.</p>

<p>Another idea that resonated with me was that you cannot love others in a mature way if you have not learned to love yourself in a healthy way—not from narcissism, but from honest acceptance: recognizing your flaws, your light, your shadows, and working on them without beating yourself up.</p>

<p>In short, <em>The Art of Loving</em> left me with a clear lesson: the kind of love worth building requires conscious effort. It is not spontaneous. And that does not make it any less magical; it makes it more real.</p>

<p>So the next time we talk about “finding love,” perhaps we should think more about building it—day by day, decision by decision.</p>
