    <p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>My name is Leo, currently a senior quality assurance engineer. In the lines below I want to talk about choosing a career—I know it’s a crucial decision, and in the tech world, with so many options, it can be overwhelming! If you’re reading this, you’re probably at that point, evaluating which path to take within the IT universe. And believe me, I get it!</p>

<p><strong>This post isn’t a magic guide to finding your calling</strong>, but rather a story from my own experience, with the hope of inspiring you and helping you navigate this sea of possibilities.</p>

<p>Since I was 12, I knew programming was my thing. Python was my first love, and along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I jumped into the workforce as a junior full-stack developer at 15. <em>(We all know that title just means labor exploitation.)</em></p>

<p>During my time as a web developer, I explored different areas: <strong>Data Science, web development</strong>… until I finally discovered <strong>automation</strong>! I loved automating my daily tasks to save time and mental effort (I even automated my daily outfit selection). Selenium was my entry point into one branch of this fascinating world and, through it, I learned about the QA role.</p>

<p>After three years as a Python developer, I was looking for a career change—something more dynamic, engaging, and a place to unleash my creativity—so I decided to <strong>pivot and become a QA for a video game consultancy</strong>.</p>

<p>At first I thought they were going to pay me to play video games (a childhood dream), but it turned out to be much more than that; in this role I would learn all the fundamentals of QA—its mindset, its purpose…</p>

<p>And what can I say? <strong>I fell in love!</strong></p>

<p>I was no longer there to play video games—the idea of <strong>being paid to “break things”</strong> (find software bugs) seemed incredibly appealing.</p>

<p>In this position I learned everything about QA responsibilities, tools, soft skills, and the traits needed to succeed. Over time I craved more and more QA; I landed at a couple more consultancies where I worked on several projects across different industries. Eventually I specialized in different kinds of testing: <strong>API testing, UI testing, unit testing, test automation, manual testing</strong>… And as my soft skills developed, I took on new responsibilities within my teams: <strong>test strategy, test management, DevOps, etc.</strong> (the standard path of vertically increasing responsibilities within a role)</p>

<p><strong>My path wasn’t linear.</strong> I experimented, explored, and learned from each experience until I found my true passion. And that’s my main recommendation for you: <strong>don’t be afraid to try new things!</strong> Your first job may not be the final one, but every step will bring you closer to your goal.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Research the different areas:</strong> web development, mobile app development, cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, cloud computing… There’s a world of possibilities!</li>
  <li><strong>Try different programming languages and frameworks:</strong> Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, React, Angular, Vue… Each has its own characteristics and applications. <em>(Python, Java, and Lua are my favorites.)</em></li>
  <li><strong>Don’t limit yourself to the technical:</strong> build your soft skills—communication, teamwork, problem-solving. They’re essential for any IT career.</li>
  <li><strong>Seek mentors and connect with other professionals:</strong> learn from their experiences and expand your network. <em>(Connect with me on LinkedIn!)</em></li>
  <li><strong>And above all, enjoy the process!</strong> The world of computing is constantly evolving, so stay curious and never stop learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope my story inspires you to find your own path in the exciting world of technology. Good luck on your adventure!</p>

<p>See you in the next post!</p>
